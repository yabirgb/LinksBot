#Link saver Telegram bot

##About

This was a little project to train me with node and mongo. It is a simple telegram 
bot that accepts all the url you send to him and store it in a database. 

Also you can set timezones using flags. The idea was to make a scheudle and give urls
at a certain time every day. Sadly no time left to this project
